Finally `normalize_geometry` is compatible with PostgreSQL 10, it was about time!

### What's new in Version 1.2.0
I got rid of those SRF (*set-returning functions*) appearing in a query SELECT list (both `ST_Dump()` and `ST_DumpRings()` are used to decompose polygons and multipolygons).
It's been a little trickier than expected because of PL/pgSQL plan caching policy, which caused me some major headaches and finally led to a dynamic query execution as the only viable solution.
Don't worry, performances are even better than before thanks to some conditional `LEFT JOIN LATERAL`. That plan caching wasn't necessary at all.
