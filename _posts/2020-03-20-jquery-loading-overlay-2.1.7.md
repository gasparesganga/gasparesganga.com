A long time has passed since the last release!
This one is still a tiny bugfix, waiting for the next major release that will be possible once Intersection Observer and Resize Observer API will be widely supported by web browsers...


### What's fixed in version 2.1.7
- Bug affecting settings and in particular size when applied to multiple target elements using a single jQuery selector
